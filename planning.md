# Plan
by the end of the project i would like to have the pi use information from the camera to build a model of the course, use the model to make descisions about what to do, then use the camera aswell to determine it's current location and move with pwm commands to the motors

* take camera data.
* build model of course including current position in course
* make good descisions about what to do to get to the end fast.
